```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eshajha19/agri.git

```bash
cd frontend
```

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### Start Dev Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

#### Preview Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
```

### 3. Backend (Python — FastAPI)

```bash
cd ..
```

#### Create Virtual Environment (Optional)

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Linux/Mac:
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Run FastAPI Server

```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

### 4. Firebase Setup

1. Create a Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Enable Firestore (or Realtime DB) and Firebase Auth (Email/Phone)
3. Add Firebase config to frontend `.env` file (see `.env.example`)
4. (Optional) Deploy security rules found in `firebase/`

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables (.env.example)

### Backend

```env
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key
SOIL_API_KEY=your_soil_api_key
FIREBASE_ADMIN_CRED=/path/to/serviceAccountKey.json
BACKEND_PORT=5000
```

### Frontend

```env
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=xxxxxxxxxxxx
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your-app.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your-app
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend.onrender.com
# Alternative: VITE_BACKEND_URL is also supported as a fallback

For Vercel deployments, set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to the live backend origin in the project environment variables. Without it, browser requests stay on the static frontend host and marketplace API calls will fail.

For certified/bank report generation, the backend also needs a signing key source. In production, configure either Google Cloud Secret Manager (`GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT` + `REPORT_SIGNING_SECRET_NAME`) or `REPORT_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PEM` with a PEM-encoded Ed25519 private key.

---

## 🧩 API Endpoints (Examples)

### Backend (FastAPI)

- `GET /api/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}` — Returns current weather + forecast
- `POST /api/soil/analyze` — Send soil params (pH, NPK) to get recommendations
- `POST /api/crop/recommend` — Returns recommended crops for given soil & climate
- `POST /api/crop-disease/analyze-image` — Analyze an uploaded crop image and return the likely disease, confidence, and treatment guidance
- `POST /api/experiments/{exp_id}/traffic-split` — Update experiment traffic split for A/B testing
- `POST /api/experiments/{exp_id}/evaluate` — Evaluate experiment metrics and auto-promote a winner when the lift is clear
- `POST /api/experiments/assign` — Assign a user to a variant and emit an impression event

(Document exact request/response schemas in docs/ or OpenAPI spec.)

## 🧪 Testing

- Frontend: use Vitest / React Testing Library
- Backend: pytest / unittest
- Add CI with GitHub Actions for linting + tests + deploy

## 🔒 Security CI

The repository now includes a dedicated security gate for secret scanning, dependency SCA, and policy enforcement.

Local policy check:

```bash
python scripts/security_ci.py policy --root . --policy .github/security-policy.json
```

The GitHub Actions workflow at [`.github/workflows/security-ci.yml`](.github/workflows/security-ci.yml) runs:

- secret scanning and repository policy enforcement via `scripts/security_ci.py`
- dependency SCA via `pip-audit` and `safety`

Test fixtures are excluded from the secret scan so synthetic examples in the test suite do not fail the gate.

## 🔒 Differential Privacy (DP-SGD) Proof of Concept

Yield model training now supports an optional differential privacy mode.

### What is included

- `training_mode=dp_sgd` in `train_model.py` using optional `torch + opacus`
- Configurable privacy targets via `epsilon` and `delta`
- Privacy accounting logs during training (target epsilon, spent epsilon, noise multiplier)
- Manifest/registry metadata now include privacy fields when DP mode is used
- A reproducible comparison script to evaluate baseline vs DP utility

### DP config example

```json
{
	"dataset": "Train.csv",
	"seed": 42,
	"training_mode": "dp_sgd",
	"epsilon": 3.0,
	"delta": 0.00001,
	"dp_epochs": 8,
	"dp_batch_size": 64,
	"dp_learning_rate": 0.05,
	"dp_max_grad_norm": 1.0,
	"output_model": "yield_model_dp.pt"
}
```

### Baseline config example

```json
{
	"dataset": "Train.csv",
	"seed": 42,
	"training_mode": "baseline",
	"output_model": "yield_model.joblib"
}
```

### Run reproducible utility comparison

```bash
python scripts/compare_dp_utility.py --dataset Train.csv --epsilon 3.0 --delta 1e-5 --seed 42 --output dp_utility_comparison.json
```

### Optional dependencies for DP mode

DP mode is optional and requires extra packages:

```bash
pip install torch opacus
```

## 🔁 ONNX conversion, GPU inference path, and benchmarking

We provide utilities to convert models to ONNX, run inference preferring GPU (if available) with CPU fallback, and run inference benchmarks.

Conversion script:

```bash
python scripts/convert_model_to_onnx.py --model path/to/model.joblib --n-features 39 --out model.onnx
```

Run ONNX inference benchmark (example):

```bash
python benchmarks/benchmark_inference.py --model model.onnx --input-shape 1,39 --iterations 200 --warmup 20 --output bench.json
```

The inference wrapper `inference/onnx_runtime.py` selects `CUDAExecutionProvider` when available, otherwise falls back to `CPUExecutionProvider`.

## 🧪 A/B Testing Runner

The feature-flag A/B testing stack now includes a runner that handles deterministic traffic splits, metric ingestion, and automatic winner promotion.

### What it does

- Assigns users to variants using the configured traffic split.
- Logs impression and conversion events into the experiment metrics pipeline.
- Evaluates conversion-rate lift and promotes the winning variant automatically when the threshold is met.
- After promotion, the winner receives 100% traffic and future assignments route to the promoted variant.

### Key endpoints

```bash
POST /api/experiments/{exp_id}/traffic-split
POST /api/experiments/{exp_id}/evaluate
POST /api/experiments/assign
```

### Example traffic split payload

```json
{
	"variants": [
		{"id": "control", "weight": 40},
		{"id": "treatment", "weight": 60}
	]
}
```


### Tradeoffs

- Better privacy guarantees usually require stronger noise (lower utility).
- Lower epsilon means stronger privacy but can increase RMSE.
- DP training is typically slower than baseline training.
- This implementation is a research proof-of-concept and should be calibrated before production use.
