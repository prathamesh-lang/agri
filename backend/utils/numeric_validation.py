    """Validate and coerce numeric fields in *data*, returning a sanitised copy.

    For every field in *field_list* that is present and non-``None`` in *data*:

    1. Coerce the value to ``float``; raise ``HTTP 400`` on conversion failure.
    2. Reject non-finite values (``inf``, ``-inf``, ``nan``); raise ``HTTP 400``.
    3. For any field whose name also appears in *ph_fields*, reject values
       outside ``[0, 14]``; raise ``HTTP 400``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data:
        Mapping of field names to their raw values (typically from a Pydantic
        model's ``model_dump()`` or a form-parsing step).
    field_list:
        Names of the fields to validate.  Fields absent from *data* or whose
        value is ``None`` are silently skipped.
    ph_fields:
        Field names that represent pH measurements and must stay within
        ``[0, 14]``.  Defaults to ``("ph", "pH")``.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A shallow copy of *data* with validated fields replaced by their
        ``float`` representations.

    Raises
    ------
    fastapi.HTTPException
        ``status_code=400`` for any invalid or out-of-range value.
